# ContextSteering
An implementation of Context Steering  in C# code within Unity, based off of Andrew Fray's paper titled "Context Steering: Behavior-Driven Steering at the Macro Scale". Context steering is intended to be an improvement on "Steering Behaviors" by allowing for more finely tuned and intelligent movement.

My implementation is an improvement upon the regular "Seek" steering behavior as it also actively avoids obstacles as it seeks out its prescribed target.
